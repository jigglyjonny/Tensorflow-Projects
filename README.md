# Jigglyjonny: Jonny's Tensorflow Projects
A repo for some machine learning projects. This repo stores *.ipynb* notebooks for machine learning applications. 

## My first projects

Keras datasets:

1. mnist: simple deep learning algorithm. Achieves 97% accuracy.

Colab sample statsets:

1. california housing: achieves $40,000 deviation from actual value.
